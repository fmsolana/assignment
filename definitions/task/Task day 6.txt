1. Do abstract class for test server in https and http.  Set SSLConext trustAll true
2. add run mode with default insecure keystore and configurable keystore
3. Http2 is not available for spark 2.9.0 (wait for 3.0.0), 
I saw possibilities because the jetty version use bye spark
support http2, candidates javalin that is a fork of spark, 
maybe in web part I use javalin
